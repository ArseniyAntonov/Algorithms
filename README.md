# python-algorithms
python-algorithms project is a collection of algorithms implemented on `Python3.6`
You don't need to install these project as a module (via pip) because usually you just need only one algorithm instead of all pack, so just copy and paste the source code.
For easy navigation please use links to the source code below.

## Implemented algorithms:

### Arithmetic
 - [GCD [Greatest Common Divisor]](arithmetic/gcd.py)
 - [LCM [Least Common Multiple]](arithmetic/lcm.py)

### Greedy
 - [Covering segments](greedy/covering_segments.py)
 - [Fractional knapsack](greedy/fractional_knapsack.py)
 
### Searching
 - [Binary search](search/binary_search.py)
 - [Closest pair](search/closest_pair.py)
 - [Fibonacci [Recursive method]](search/fibonacci.py)
 - [Fibonacci by Modulo [with Pisano period]](search/fibonacci_modulo.py)
 - [Rabin-Karp algorithm](search/rabinkarp.py)
 - Hash chains example
### Sorting
 - Merge sort
 - Quick sort [3 partitions with randomized pivot]
### Algorithms on Graphs:
 - Topological Sort
 - DFS (Depth first search)
 - SCC (Strongly connected components)
 - BFS (Breadth first search)
 - Bipartite (Algorithms based on BFS for check that grap is bipartite)
 - Bellman-Ford algorithm (and negative cycle detection based on this approach)
 - Bellman-Ford algorithm (and negative cycle detection based on this approach + infinity Arbitrage detection)
 - Kruskal algorithm for connecting points
 - Dijkstra (on priority queue)
 - Bidirectional Dijkstra (on priority queues)
 - AStar  (potential function - euclidean distance)
 - [BST checker](graphs/bst_check.py)
### Dynamic Programming
 - [Knapsack](dynamic_programming/knapsack.py)

## Unsorted:
 - Tree traversal methods (in/pre/post order recursive and iterative)
 - Rope data structure (heavyweight strings based on splay tree with iterative in order traversal)
